- 👋 Hi, I’m @for4school, a student struggling through a mechanical engineering degree.
- 👀 I’m interested in cars and getting my hands dirty.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code in Python. It is pretty hard!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now.
- 📫 How to reach me: through github.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I cannot work with concepts, it does not work with how I learn. Physical learning is more my speed.
